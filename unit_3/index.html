	<h3>who are we?</h3>
	<p>We are two 20-something professionals living in LA with M-F jobs and next to no vacation time. We love to travel, explore, and eat, and we prefer to do that outside the confines of home. With limited free time and funds, we’ve learned to scratch our travelling itch by embracing the magic that is the weekend.<br> Because life is too short.<br>
	We are The Weekenders.</p>
